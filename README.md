# Minimal Fish Theme

A minimal theme for Fish I created to suit my own needs. Some assumptions have been made pertaining to my setup (light-on-dark colors, vi mode).

## Performance

Performance is usually imperceptibly affected, however in a massive Git repo, particularly on weaker hardware, you might notice some prompt delay. To resolve this you can install [fish-async-prompt](https://github.com/acomagu/fish-async-prompt).
